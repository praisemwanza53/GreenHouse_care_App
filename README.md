# GreenHouse_care_App
Design and fabrication of an IOT monitoring and controlling system for greenhouse application.
Certain crops like vanilla orchids and saffron,crucial for biscuit, bread, and cake production,cannot be cultivated locally due to our harsh environment. Consequently, we heavily rely onimports for these ingredients, exacerbating our trade deficit and weakening our currency.This reliance on imports not only increases the cost of living but also leaves us vulnerable to fluctuations in global market prices. Additionally,importing essential ingredients for food production undermines our food security and economic independence.

Using IoT technology, the project aims to replicate the native tropical environmental
conditions required for the cultivation of foreign crops like vanilla orchids and saffron.This will enable local production of these crops, reducing reliance on imports and enhancing agricultural sustainability.

The ojectives include
1. To design a robust and scalable architecture for the IoT-based greenhousemonitoring and controllingsystem
2. To select and integrate appropriate sensors and actuators to measure environmental parameters and control greenhouse 
   components, called the Greenhouse careBox.
3. To integrate communication protocols and interfaces for seamless data exchange between sensors, actuators
   and the central IoT platform.
4. To design a user-friendly mobile app for remote monitoring, control, and management of the greenhouse system, called the 
   Greenhouse Care App.
